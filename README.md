## 🔬 Projects in Machine Learning, Neuroimaging, Data Analysis and High Energy Physics

## Selected Research Projects

### [Brain Age Prediction from MRI](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/BrainAge-CNN)  
**Research question:** How does structural information in MRI encode biological aging, and how do representation choices affect generalization?

This project frames brain age regression as a representation learning problem. The focus is on how data geometry, slicing strategies, and preprocessing assumptions influence learned age-related features, prioritizing interpretability and robustness over architectural complexity.


### [fNIRS PCA–ICA Finger Tapping Analysis](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/fnirs-pca-ica-finger-tapping)  
**Research question:** Can latent components extracted from multivariate fNIRS signals be meaningfully related to task structure and physiology?

This work studies unsupervised decomposition of neurophysiological time series, treating PCA and ICA as explicit modeling assumptions about signal generation. Emphasis is placed on component interpretability, cross-subject consistency, and alignment with experimental timing.


### [Breast Cancer Clustering Analysis](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/data-mining-breast-cancer)  
**Research question:** How do normalization and representation choices affect unsupervised structure discovery?

This project explores clustering as a representation problem, analyzing how preprocessing pipelines and dimensionality reduction strategies reshape the data manifold and influence downstream interpretability, rather than optimizing for a single clustering score.


### [Spin Correlations in \(t\bar{t}\) Production (SMEFT)](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/spin-correlations-smeft)  
**Research question:** How can learning-based observables probe theoretically well-defined quantities?

This work studies spin correlations in top-quark pair production as a bridge between data-driven analysis and effective field theory, focusing on interpreting statistical observables in terms of SMEFT operators rather than replacing theory with machine learning.


### [IceCube ML Classification](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/icecube-ml-classification)  
**Research question:** How do classical ML models capture structure in high-dimensional detector data?

This project treats particle classification as a case study in feature representation and inductive bias, comparing how different algorithms encode physical information under limited supervision and noisy Monte Carlo data.


### [LHCb Mass Fit](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/lhcb-mass-fit)  
**Research question:** How do statistical modeling choices affect signal extraction?

Here the emphasis is on invariant mass reconstruction as a statistical inference problem, focusing on background modeling, uncertainty estimation, and the interpretability of fitted parameters in heavy-flavor physics.


### [ROOT B-Physics Analysis](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/bphysics-root-analysis)  
**Research question:** How do reconstruction-level decisions propagate to physics-level conclusions?

This analysis highlights the connection between low-level invariant mass reconstruction and rare decay searches, emphasizing how methodological choices affect physical observables.


### [ROOT B-Physics Analysis](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/bphysics-root-analysis)
Invariant mass reconstruction and rare B-meson decay analysis using ROOT.
