## 🧠 Machine Learning & Neuroimaging

### [Brain Age Prediction from MRI](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/BrainAge-CNN)
End-to-end deep learning pipeline for brain age regression from structural MRI.

- Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to estimate brain age from T1-weighted MRI scans.
- Designed a 3D-to-2D preprocessing pipeline to systematically study slice-selection strategies.
- Evaluated regression performance using MAE, RMSE, \(R^2\), Pearson correlation, and age-bin error analysis.
- Built a modular and reproducible pipeline to facilitate future extensions and model comparisons.
