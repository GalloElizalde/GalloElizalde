## 🔬 Projects in Machine Learning, Neuroimaging, Data Analysis and High Energy Physics

#### Selected Research Projects

#### [Brain Age Prediction from MRI](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/BrainAge-CNN)  

This project frames brain age regression as a representation learning problem. The focus is on how data geometry, slicing strategies, and preprocessing assumptions influence learned age-related features, prioritizing interpretability and robustness over architectural complexity.


#### [fNIRS PCA–ICA Finger Tapping Analysis](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/fnirs-pca-ica-finger-tapping)  

This work studies unsupervised decomposition of neurophysiological time series, treating PCA and ICA as explicit modeling assumptions about signal generation. Emphasis is placed on component interpretability, cross-subject consistency, and alignment with experimental timing.


#### [Breast Cancer Clustering Analysis](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/data-mining-breast-cancer)  

This project explores clustering as a representation problem, analyzing how preprocessing pipelines and dimensionality reduction strategies reshape the data manifold and influence downstream interpretability, rather than optimizing for a single clustering score.


#### [Spin Correlations in \(t\bar{t}\) Production (SMEFT)](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/spin-correlations-smeft)  

This work studies spin correlations in top-quark pair production as a bridge between data-driven analysis and effective field theory, focusing on interpreting statistical observables in terms of SMEFT operators rather than replacing theory with machine learning.


#### [IceCube ML Classification](https://github.com/GalloElizalde/icecube-ml-classification)  

This project treats particle classification as a case study in feature representation and inductive bias, comparing how different algorithms encode physical information under limited supervision and noisy Monte Carlo data.
